# Discord Selfbot with character.ai 

This project is a [Discord selfbot](https://github.com/aiko-chan-ai/discord.js-selfbot-v13) that integrates with [CharacterAI API](https://github.com/realcoloride/node_characterai) to provide AI responses as messages.

## Installation
Node.js 16.0+ or newer is recommended

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Copy the .env.example to .env and provide your own Discord token and c.ai token

## Usage

The bot listens for messages that contain the word "keqing". When such a message is detected, it sends the message content to the CharacterAI API and awaits a response.
